# Go Advent of Code 2023

This is my first attempt at AoC. I've been learning go recently and thought it would be a good chance to test my skills.

## Run the Program

All of the inputs are included in the repo. You simply need to build and run the binary with the puzzle number as the first argument

```
go build && ./go-aoc-2023 1
```
